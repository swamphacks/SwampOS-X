		<p>Dear Hackers, Sponsors, Judges, and Friends,</p>
		<p>
			As we reflect on this incredible event, we&apos;re overwhelmed with gratitude for each and
			every one of you who made this hackathon possible. From the moment the first line of code was
			written to the final project demos, your passion and innovation were inspiring.
		</p>
		<p>
			This weekend was about more than just building—it was about learning, collaborating, and
			creating something meaningful together. Whether you were shipping your first project,
			mentoring a team, or helping run logistics, you were a vital part of this experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			We&apos;re proud to say this hackathon saw <strong>over 250 attendees</strong>,
			<strong>50+ projects</strong>, and more caffeine consumed than we&apos;d like to admit. Thank
			you for trusting us with your weekend. We can&apos;t wait to do it again—bigger, better, and
			bolder.
		</p>
		<p class="font-semibold">
			With gratitude,<br />
			Shane and Wilson
